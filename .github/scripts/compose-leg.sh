# `adb root` restarts adbd, so the transport drops and comes back a moment
# later: the root call itself, the wait-for-device, the getprop and the id check
# can each fail transiently with "adb: unable to connect for root: closed" or an
# empty shell reply. Retry the whole block as a unit rather than any single line
# - re-running `adb root` is a no-op that exits 0 once adbd is already root.
# Worst case is 10 * (20s wait + 3s sleep), which still leaves room in the
# step budget after the AVD boot and the compose --wait timeouts.
# The values are captured into variables instead of piped into `grep -q`,
# because `grep -q` exits at the first match and can SIGPIPE the adb writer,
# which `set -o pipefail` then reports as a failure of a check that passed.
